                <p>I have had an interest in coding for a few years now but didn&apos;t know quite where to begin.
                I knew my end game was DevOps, Front/Back End Development or Full Stack and of course UX/UI Design. I wanted to do it all&excl;<br>
                
                <br>So, I started asking questions!<br>
                
                <br>It was absolutely a follow the white rabbit moment and sure enough I went down that rabbit hole. I wasn't prepared for what I found
                but one thing was certain I wanted to quit my day jobs and figure out a way to make it happen. A couple years and a few free courses 
                later...here I am ~ but could I actually do it&quest;<br>
                
                <br>Well, only one way to find out - let the journey begin&excl;</p>
